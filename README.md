# PickOne! Randomizer

> This app is designed so that a participant can be chosen randomly in a meeting. The main difference with other sites of this type, is that a user creates a session for that meeting and then can share the link with others, and everyone can add their name. That way names don't have to be added by a single user, which is especially useful for large meetings.
